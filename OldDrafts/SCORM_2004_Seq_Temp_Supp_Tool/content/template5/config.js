{ "tid" : "t05","tdescHeader" : "Template 5:  Remediation Using Objectives", "tdesc" : "Template 5 presents a sequencing option for learner remediation when you have multiple instructional SCOs.  This inter-SCO remediation is tracked by the LMS using objectives (OBJs).  The test for this structure exists as a single SCO with two test items (the assets).  The post-test (SCO-3) uses objectives to link each test item to its corresponding instructional SCO.  Based upon the learnerâ€™s response to the test item, the OBJ for that item is set to passed or failed.  For failed objectives, the LMS shows the learner the list of corresponding instructional SCOs and the learner can select the SCO to view the remediation." }
