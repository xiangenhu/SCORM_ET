{ "tid" : "t03","tdescHeader" : "Template 3:  The Black Box", "tdesc" : "Template 3 contains no sequencing.  It is a single SCO with intra-SCO branching.  The intra-SCO branching may be as complex or as simple as the designer defines.  With this type of intra-SCO branching, the learning management system (LMS) does not know what happens inside the SCO.  This means the LMS cannot track or report the learner’s progress through the content.  While this is an effective way to control the learner’s instructional experience, it does not permit the flexibility SCORM seeks to provide." }
