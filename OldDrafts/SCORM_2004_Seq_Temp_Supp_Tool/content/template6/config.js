{ "tid" : "t06","tdescHeader" : "Template 6:  Pre- and Post-Test Sequencing", "tdesc" : "This template presents a sequencing option for pre- and post-tests of learner knowledge or skills.  The pre- and post-tests for this structure exist as individual SCOs.  Each post-test item is an individual asset.  The testing SCOs are linked to objectives that correspond to test items within the SCO.  Based upon the learnerâ€™s response to the pre-test item, the OBJ is either set to passed or failed.  When the pre-test in SCO-1 is completed, the LMS shows the learner the SCOs corresponding to the missed test questions so the learner can complete the instruction before taking the post-test." }
