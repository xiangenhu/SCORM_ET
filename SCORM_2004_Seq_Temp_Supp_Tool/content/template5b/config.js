The learner now has the choice to view the content in any order.  The learner could even complete the post-test in SCO-3 without first viewing SCOs 1 and 2.  The objectives and remediation work the same way in Application B as they do in Application A; however, the learner is now permitted as many attempts as needed to pass the post-test in SCO-3." }
