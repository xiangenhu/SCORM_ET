    "tdesc": "Template 10 provides a more complex pre- and post-test structure that enables learners to remediate to content that is hidden until needed for remediation.  Both the pre- and post-tests are required.  Based on the learnerâ€™s responses to the pre-test in SCO-A, OBJ-1 and OBJ-2 will be set to passed or failed.  Assume the learner fails OBJ-2.  A typical LMS will then show SCO-2a on a list.  The learner will choose SCO-2a and then take a post-test (SCO-3a) to ensure they understand the content from both SCOs 1a and 2a.  If the learner passes both OBJ-3 and OBJ-4 from SCO-3b, then the learner will complete Aggregation-B, thereby completing the root aggregation.  </p> <p> Assume the learner failed OBJ-4 in SCO-3a.  The LMS will present the learner with SCO-1b.  SCO-1b contains new instructional material (remediation) that is an enhancement of the content from SCO-1a.  Since the learner initially struggled with the content, and the learner is required to master the content, the learner must now pass the post-test in SCO-3b to complete the root aggregation.  If the learner fails SCO-3b, then the learner will be halted in training according to these rules.  (You could also structure the rules such that the learner passed after a defined number of attempts.)  If the learner passes the post-test in SCO-3b, then the root aggregation is considered complete.  </p>"
