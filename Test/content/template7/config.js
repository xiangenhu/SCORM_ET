{ "tid" : "t07","tdescHeader" : "Template 7:  Pre- and Post-Test Sequencing (2)", "tdesc" : "Template 7 shows a simple way to construct a pre- and post-test “course” (the root aggregation) without remediation.  The pre-test sets the objectives (OBJ-2 and OBJ-3) to passed or failed depending upon the learner’s response to the individual test items.  If you assume the learner fails OBJ-2 in the pre-test, then the learner would be presented with SCO-2.  The learner would be able to view the instruction that was not passed in the pre-test.  He could also review the other material as well (choice = true).  The rules for the diagram require the learner to master the post-test by passing both OBJ-2 and OBJ-3." }
